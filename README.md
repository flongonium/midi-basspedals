# Midi Controller with Raspberry Pi and Arduino
This project is based on the idea and codes of vanceg:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Build-MIDI-Bass-Pedals-for-About-150/

**Stuff used:**
* Arduino Mega2560
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Old Wurtlizer organ pedals
* Adressable RGB leds
* Standard leds
* Push buttons and faders

Some .h files are not used and were just some ideas.

The idea is to build your own midi controller for live usage.
This project is extended with a Raspberry Pi as an interface for different midi sources and because my Midi Device could not understand the commands.
